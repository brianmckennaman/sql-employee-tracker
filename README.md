# sql-employee-tracker

The goal of this assignment was to create a CLI to track employee data. First, I created a company database and tables to hold data for the departments, roles, and employees. Then, I created a series of inquirer promtps for users to use to view data, insert new data, or update existing data.

A video walkthrough demonstrating the app's functionality can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1piOe4ffLfMJbATW8OnTCdRDDjeqFdNOT/view
